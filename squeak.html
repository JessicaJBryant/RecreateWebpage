    <!-- This was a lot of trial and error to get this right. And I still don't know that I have it exactly right. I seem to have a larger spack between Squeak 5 and Squeak 6 than Matt does, but nothing I've tried to do will fix it. I've researched a little (did the shift option f to see if the code spacing was it) but no time today to do more if I want to make my kiddo's soccer gamme. -->
